DojoTest
========

My Dojo Test to keep some basic knowledge of Dojo

The test code are categorized into several folders:

# djcore
- 	which covers the core test cases, e.g. dojo class systems, inheritance, etc. 
- 	Moodule system

# dijitTest
- 	simple dijit test cases 
    -   It has one sample for dojo grid (for dojo 1.6)
    -   Another simple test for a menu
